v1.0.1:
- New mouseover bar mode: fades in on hover, fades out after a per-bar,
  configurable delay (default 1s). Bar stays clickable while faded out.
- Config Mode, Keybind Mode and active drag/drop keep bars fully visible.

v0.3.21:
- Centralized visible UI strings in Locale.lua.
- English cleanup for bar controls and chat messages.

Stable base:
- Multiple bars, drag/drop, tooltips, stack counts, configure mode, minimap button.
- Central minimap configuration menu for bar selection and settings.
- Left-click opens the menu, right-click toggles Configure Mode, Shift + Left-click toggles Keybind Mode.


v0.4.9
- Fixed normal-mode drag & drop by showing temporary drop slots on bar hover.
- Blocked BUTTON1/BUTTON2 keybind assignment for safety.

Version 0.4.15 swap timing stability.


v0.4.15: Internal slot-to-slot dragging now swaps ButtonForge ActionSlot references instead of using PickupAction/PlaceAction.

0.4.19: Real per-character SavedVariables for bars, settings and keybinds.


0.4.24: Safe runtime keybindings. ButtonForge no longer calls SaveBindings(). Keybinds are stored in addon SavedVariables and applied at login only.
